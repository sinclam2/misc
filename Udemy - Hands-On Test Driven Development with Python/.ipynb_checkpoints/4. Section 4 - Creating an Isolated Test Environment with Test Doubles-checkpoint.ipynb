    "\n",
    "- Test doubles are objects that can be used in unit tests in the place of a real thing\n",
    "    - E.g. if our unit test queries a rest API, the test may fail not because of a problem with the code, but because the rest API is down for some reason\n",
    "        - Instead of relying on the API, we can create a replacement for the results of the query, and feed those into the test"
