    "        - In periods of economic expansion, having capital tied up in bonds has higher opportunity cost\n",

    "                - This increases demand for short term bonds, thereby driving up their market price, and therefore reducing the YTM\n",
    "                - Similarly, reduced demand for longer term bonds put downward pressure on their market prices, therefore increasing their YTM\n",
    "                    - **Combining these effects leads to the normal yield curve shape**\n",
