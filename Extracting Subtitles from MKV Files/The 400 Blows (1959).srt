1
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:22,212
THE 400 BLOWS

2
00:02:51,275 --> 00:02:55,872
DEDICATED TO THE MEMORY
OF ANDRE BAZI N

3
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:54,125
Doinel, bring me that.

4
00:04:01,303 --> 00:04:04,068
Nice. Go stand in the corner.

5
00:04:10,849 --> 00:04:12,783
You've got one minute left.

6
00:04:13,052 --> 00:04:14,952
Silence!

7
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:18,857
Papers will be collected in 30 seconds.

8
00:04:19,061 --> 00:04:20,619
Quiet!

9
00:04:28,073 --> 00:04:30,132
Row leaders, get ready.

10
00:04:34,381 --> 00:04:36,281
I'll count to three.

11
00:04:37,885 --> 00:04:39,478
One.

12
00:04:39,788 --> 00:04:41,380
Two.

13
00:04:42,759 --> 00:04:44,454
Three. Collect the papers.

14
00:04:52,606 --> 00:04:54,369
Get the others first.

15
00:04:56,311 --> 00:04:57,903
- Give it to me.
-Just a second.

16
00:04:58,179 --> 00:05:00,147
- What's going on?
- He won't turn it in.

17
00:05:00,249 --> 00:05:02,445
No special treatment!

18
00:05:03,321 --> 00:05:04,583
Brownnose.

19
00:05:06,425 --> 00:05:08,325
Do I have everyone's paper?

20
00:05:08,594 --> 00:05:10,255
You may go.

21
00:05:12,032 --> 00:05:14,399
Not you, my friend!

22
00:05:15,404 --> 00:05:18,271
Recess is a reward, not a right.

23
00:05:55,091 --> 00:05:58,322
Here poor Antoine Doinel was
unfairly punished by Sourpuss

24
00:05:58,428 --> 00:06:01,421
for a pinup that fell from the sky.

25
00:06:01,699 --> 00:06:04,668
It will be an eye for an eye,
a tooth for a tooth.

26
00:06:04,770 --> 00:06:07,933
Hey, champs, maybe you need
a referee over here.

27
00:06:08,241 --> 00:06:12,703
No recess for three days.
That'll teach you.

28
00:06:23,829 --> 00:06:26,093
Look at this!

29
00:06:27,033 --> 00:06:29,627
What's so interesting there?

30
00:06:29,871 --> 00:06:31,668
Take your seats!

31
00:06:43,055 --> 00:06:45,523
We have a young Juvenal in our class,

32
00:06:45,758 --> 00:06:48,887
though he doesn't know an Alexandrine
from blank verse.

33
00:06:49,564 --> 00:06:51,759
Doinel, for tomorrow
you will conjugate -

34
00:06:52,034 --> 00:06:54,559
Take your seat and write this down.

35
00:06:56,439 --> 00:06:59,204
In all tenses of the indicative,
conditional and subjunctive -

36
00:06:59,478 --> 00:07:02,106
The rest of you,
get out your notebooks.

37
00:07:04,117 --> 00:07:07,609
''I deface the classroom walls...

38
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:13,958
and abuse French verse.''

39
00:07:16,434 --> 00:07:18,231
''The Hare''!

40
00:07:26,547 --> 00:07:31,315
Doinel, go get something
to wipe that rubbish off the wall,

41
00:07:31,421 --> 00:07:33,913
or I'll make you lick it off!.

42
00:07:37,295 --> 00:07:41,528
Richer, who said
you could change seats?

43
00:07:51,448 --> 00:07:54,815
''In the season when the thickets

44
00:07:58,791 --> 00:08:03,559
Glow with crimson flowers

45
00:08:07,536 --> 00:08:10,699
When the black tip

46
00:08:20,488 --> 00:08:23,048
Of my long ears

47
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:27,420
Could already be seen

48
00:08:29,933 --> 00:08:32,402
Above

49
00:08:35,308 --> 00:08:38,106
The still-green rye

50
00:08:43,485 --> 00:08:47,582
From which I nibbled

51
00:08:50,761 --> 00:08:53,457
The tender stems

52
00:08:56,637 --> 00:09:00,004
As I frolicked about

53
00:09:07,952 --> 00:09:09,749
One day

54
00:09:13,225 --> 00:09:15,318
Fatigued

55
00:09:20,736 --> 00:09:22,704
I was fast asleep

56
00:09:25,508 --> 00:09:27,100
In my hutch

57
00:09:28,012 --> 00:09:30,948
When little Margot surprised me there''

58
00:09:35,689 --> 00:09:37,714
- I saw you, Simonot!
- I didn't do anything, sir.

59
00:09:37,825 --> 00:09:39,349
It's always someone else.

60
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:43,694
''She loved me so

61
00:09:44,634 --> 00:09:47,398
My beautiful little mistress

62
00:09:57,852 --> 00:10:00,412
What kindness she showed me

63
00:10:00,956 --> 00:10:03,482
How caring and tender

64
00:10:04,662 --> 00:10:08,120
How she hugged me on her little lap

65
00:10:08,467 --> 00:10:10,594
And kissed me''

66
00:10:11,571 --> 00:10:13,368
Who's the idiot who whistled?

67
00:10:13,473 --> 00:10:17,103
I warn you, speak up
or your neighbor will get it.

68
00:10:17,345 --> 00:10:20,678
You hear me, Simonot?
- It wasn't me, sir.

69
00:10:21,451 --> 00:10:23,214
And cowards to boot!

70
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:25,083
What a class this year!

71
00:10:25,189 --> 00:10:29,252
I've known idiots before,
but at least they were polite!

72
00:10:29,362 --> 00:10:31,660
They kept their heads down
and didn't get caught.

73
00:10:31,865 --> 00:10:36,030
And you -you call that clean?
You made it filthier!

74
00:10:36,137 --> 00:10:38,902
Go to your seat and copy this down.
Your parents will pay the price.

75
00:10:39,008 --> 00:10:42,466
Poor France will be in sorry shape
in ten years!

76
00:10:49,957 --> 00:10:53,415
- Everyone swipes money from their parents.
- Maybe, but it isn't easy.

77
00:10:53,528 --> 00:10:55,257
I bet even Mauricet does it.

78
00:10:55,364 --> 00:10:57,798
Hey, Mauricet,
we want to ask you something.

79
00:10:58,033 --> 00:11:01,196
Where'd you get those fancy glasses?
- I bought them.

80
00:11:01,304 --> 00:11:03,899
Did you pinch the money
from your mom or your dad?

81
00:11:04,343 --> 00:11:07,710
Don't pretend you don't go
through their pockets.

82
00:11:07,981 --> 00:11:11,439
You're the louse
who squealed on me today!

83
00:11:11,886 --> 00:11:13,855
You're a louse, Mauricet!

84
00:11:14,056 --> 00:11:15,523
Your days are numbered.

85
00:11:15,825 --> 00:11:17,690
You'll get yours!

86
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:23,092
I'll never finish my homework tonight.

87
00:11:32,581 --> 00:11:35,709
- Sourpuss is a real asshole.
- That's his job.

88
00:11:35,951 --> 00:11:40,253
Still, I'm gonna smash his face in
before I go to the army!

89
00:11:40,725 --> 00:11:43,057
See you.

90
00:13:47,464 --> 00:13:50,831
''I deface the classroom walls. ''

91
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:07,146
- Evening, Mother.
- Evening.

92
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:17,630
- Where's the flour?
- What flour?

93
00:14:17,904 --> 00:14:21,102
Didn't you buy what I told you to?

94
00:14:21,843 --> 00:14:25,506
Where's the list I left you?
- I lost it.

95
00:14:25,615 --> 00:14:27,515
No wonder you get such bad grades.

96
00:14:27,818 --> 00:14:29,718
Go get my slippers.

97
00:14:31,791 --> 00:14:35,022
In the bedroom, under the bed.

98
00:14:41,068 --> 00:14:44,596
I need that flour.
Go get it right away.

99
00:15:03,833 --> 00:15:06,769
They had to use forceps.

100
00:15:06,871 --> 00:15:09,533
Seems it runs in the family.
Same thing happened to her mother.

101
00:15:09,775 --> 00:15:13,837
That means nothing.
With Fanny it was over in ten minutes.

102
00:15:13,947 --> 00:15:17,577
But if they hadn't done a caesarian
for the last one,

103
00:15:17,686 --> 00:15:19,654
I wouldn't be talking to you now.

104
00:15:19,755 --> 00:15:22,417
And my sister, with one every year.
Can you imagine?

105
00:15:22,559 --> 00:15:25,494
The doctor warned her.

106
00:15:26,331 --> 00:15:30,827
She had to have surgery.
There was blood everywhere.

107
00:15:34,041 --> 00:15:37,374
- Always running, eh, son?
- I got bawled out 'cause of this flour.

108
00:15:37,679 --> 00:15:42,414
You mustn't make your mother mad.
You have to handle her gently.

109
00:15:42,786 --> 00:15:46,119
- What's that?
- A fog light.

110
00:15:46,224 --> 00:15:48,784
I'm gonna try it out
at the race on Sunday.

111
00:15:58,874 --> 00:16:03,142
- Look at your little flour boy here.
- That's not funny!

112
00:16:03,448 --> 00:16:06,042
I thought it was.

113
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:10,014
- Where's my change?
- I need it for lunch at school.

114
00:16:10,123 --> 00:16:11,613
Ask your father.

115
00:16:11,825 --> 00:16:13,224
Let's have it!

116
00:16:17,567 --> 00:16:19,501
I sense a storm coming.

117
00:16:19,603 --> 00:16:21,537
- Dad, I need some money-
- What?

118
00:16:21,638 --> 00:16:24,334
I just need 1 ,000 francs.

119
00:16:24,442 --> 00:16:27,469
Which means you're hoping for 500,
meaning you really need 300,

120
00:16:28,048 --> 00:16:30,175
so here's a hundred.

121
00:16:30,418 --> 00:16:34,253
All right, 500.
But your mother should pay for that.

122
00:16:34,356 --> 00:16:35,789
Where are the scissors?

123
00:16:35,891 --> 00:16:37,825
Where are the scissors

124
00:16:37,928 --> 00:16:40,522
Stop playing the clown.
And what are you laughing about?

125
00:16:40,632 --> 00:16:44,569
This is no time for homework.
We're about to eat.

126
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:48,698
She's right. There's a time
and a place for everything.

127
00:16:50,345 --> 00:16:52,745
Where'd you get this pen?

128
00:16:53,248 --> 00:16:55,182
I traded for it.

129
00:16:55,284 --> 00:16:57,912
You've been doing
a lot of trading lately.

130
00:17:03,029 --> 00:17:05,827
What's that? Do you smell it?

131
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:09,596
- It's fish.
- Smells promising.

132
00:17:10,705 --> 00:17:14,734
Ask your mother
if the dishtowel's on fire.

133
00:17:14,911 --> 00:17:16,503
Why?

134
00:17:16,947 --> 00:17:18,676
For a laugh.

135
00:17:35,271 --> 00:17:38,241
You can clear the table, son.

136
00:17:38,510 --> 00:17:40,603
Your cousin called.

137
00:17:40,846 --> 00:17:43,508
- His wife's expecting again.
- Four kids in three years?

138
00:17:43,617 --> 00:17:45,710
Like rabbits. It's disgusting.

139
00:17:46,753 --> 00:17:49,450
Speaking of kids, what'll we do
with this one for the summer?

140
00:17:49,558 --> 00:17:52,925
- Summer camp ain't for poodles.
- And he'd be with others his age.

141
00:17:53,096 --> 00:17:57,090
- We don't have to decide yet.
- The sooner, the better.

142
00:17:59,472 --> 00:18:01,906
Don't pull too hard.

143
00:18:03,577 --> 00:18:06,205
Nice, huh?
- ''Lions Club.''

144
00:18:06,448 --> 00:18:09,611
- What's going on here?
- Hey, careful.

145
00:18:09,952 --> 00:18:13,856
Where would you like
to drive this Sunday?

146
00:18:13,958 --> 00:18:15,721
The club asked me to plan the route.

147
00:18:15,827 --> 00:18:18,159
- I want to rest on Sunday.
- Where?

148
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:22,333
- At my girlfriend's.
- What'll the guys think?

149
00:18:22,570 --> 00:18:24,265
Listen, I've had enough.

150
00:18:24,371 --> 00:18:26,965
Housework all morning and -
- And the ''touch'' system all afternoon.

151
00:18:27,075 --> 00:18:30,306
- What?
- Your typewriter or someone else's.

152
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:32,639
Antoine, time for bed now.

153
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:37,285
'Night, Dad. 'Night, Mother.

154
00:18:37,389 --> 00:18:39,084
You're such an idiot sometimes.

155
00:18:39,926 --> 00:18:42,656
You've got no sense ofhumor.

156
00:18:42,896 --> 00:18:45,194
You're wasting your time on that crap.

157
00:18:45,533 --> 00:18:48,594
Don't forget the garbage,
and turn your light out.

158
00:18:49,105 --> 00:18:53,372
I make contacts at the races.
You'll see. I'll be VPone day.

159
00:18:53,477 --> 00:18:58,280
You'll never be VP. They like you
puttering along where you are.

160
00:19:03,558 --> 00:19:07,825
Our evening programming has ended.
Good night, ladies and gentlemen.

161
00:19:41,843 --> 00:19:44,904
Get up, quick.
We didn't hear the alarm.

162
00:20:02,037 --> 00:20:05,564
''I deface the classroom walls. ''

163
00:20:09,381 --> 00:20:11,508
There's no sock left
around all these holes.

164
00:20:11,617 --> 00:20:14,245
Those have had it.
Buy some new ones.

165
00:20:14,354 --> 00:20:16,288
All your others are dirty.

166
00:20:17,024 --> 00:20:20,620
I gave you money to buy sheets
for the boy's bed, remember?

167
00:20:20,963 --> 00:20:25,731
He prefers his sleeping bag.
Right, son?

168
00:20:25,836 --> 00:20:28,100
Sure, it keeps me warm.

169
00:20:28,406 --> 00:20:30,466
You're still here?

170
00:20:31,611 --> 00:20:32,908
See you.

171
00:20:37,718 --> 00:20:40,346
- No need to run.
- We're gonna be late.

172
00:20:40,622 --> 00:20:43,615
We'll have to sneak in
and we'll get in trouble.

173
00:20:43,861 --> 00:20:46,421
- Take it easy.
- Why?

174
00:20:46,898 --> 00:20:49,423
Sourpuss said he wouldn't
let you back in.

175
00:20:49,635 --> 00:20:51,728
- You think he'll do it?
- Yeah. He can't stand you.

176
00:20:52,004 --> 00:20:54,371
Got any money?
- Lunch money.

177
00:20:54,642 --> 00:20:56,769
Then just follow me.

178
00:20:57,046 --> 00:20:58,980
What are you up to?

179
00:21:20,077 --> 00:21:21,738
Follow me.

180
00:21:22,379 --> 00:21:25,610
Put your bag behind the door.
- Will they be safe there?

181
00:21:25,950 --> 00:21:27,781
I leave mine here all the time.

182
00:25:13,526 --> 00:25:15,494
My God, it's Antoine!
I'm sure he saw me.

183
00:25:15,595 --> 00:25:17,085
Which one is yours?

184
00:25:17,197 --> 00:25:20,065
The dark-haired one.
What's he doing out of school?

185
00:25:20,169 --> 00:25:23,229
- You're really gonna get it tonight!
- She wouldn't dare tell my father.

186
00:25:23,339 --> 00:25:25,671
- Wasn't that him?
- Never saw the guy before.

187
00:25:25,976 --> 00:25:28,274
Then you're safe.

188
00:25:55,650 --> 00:25:59,815
I'm going back to school tomorrow,
but I'll need a note.

189
00:26:00,322 --> 00:26:03,758
What are you gonna do?
- I have an old one I never used.

190
00:26:04,494 --> 00:26:08,489
I'll cut off the date.
Here, you can copy it tonight.

191
00:26:08,701 --> 00:26:11,966
- What about the handwriting?
- Copy your mother's.

192
00:26:12,239 --> 00:26:14,730
That'll be hard.
She writes really funny.

193
00:26:14,975 --> 00:26:16,738
Don't worry. It'll be all right.

194
00:26:17,011 --> 00:26:19,503
I hope so. See you.

195
00:26:21,551 --> 00:26:23,576
''Dear Sir,

196
00:26:26,824 --> 00:26:29,953
Please excuse

197
00:26:34,101 --> 00:26:37,970
my son Rene

198
00:26:40,343 --> 00:26:44,247
who was sick-''

199
00:26:44,916 --> 00:26:46,747
My son Rene!

200
00:27:05,211 --> 00:27:06,769
Hi, Dad.

201
00:27:08,649 --> 00:27:12,176
- Something burning in here again?
- It's from downstairs.

202
00:27:12,554 --> 00:27:15,921
- Set the table for two tonight.
- Has Mother left?

203
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:19,322
No, she called to say
she'd be home late.

204
00:27:19,497 --> 00:27:22,159
Her boss needs her
for year-end inventory.

205
00:27:23,869 --> 00:27:27,430
You and I will have ourselves
a real bachelors' dinner.

206
00:27:28,008 --> 00:27:31,911
She said there are eggs around.
- I know where.

207
00:27:37,988 --> 00:27:41,152
- Did you work hard today?
- Yes.

208
00:27:41,327 --> 00:27:44,091
- What did you study?
- ''The Hare.''

209
00:27:44,330 --> 00:27:46,560
Ah, ''The Tortoise and the Hare.''

210
00:27:46,666 --> 00:27:49,066
No,just ''The Hare.''

211
00:27:50,238 --> 00:27:53,106
- Did you do well?
- I wasn't called on.

212
00:27:53,343 --> 00:27:56,244
You have to raise your hand
and get noticed,

213
00:27:56,347 --> 00:27:58,542
or you'll never get in the race.

214
00:27:58,649 --> 00:28:01,709
You have to take initiative in life.

215
00:28:02,387 --> 00:28:05,687
By the way, have you thought
about your mother's birthday?

216
00:28:05,859 --> 00:28:10,229
It's the 1 7 th.
I trust you'll get her something.

217
00:28:11,567 --> 00:28:13,865
Are you listening?

218
00:28:14,839 --> 00:28:16,773
I know what you're thinking:

219
00:28:17,375 --> 00:28:19,866
She's been hard on you lately.

220
00:28:20,112 --> 00:28:22,706
But she's under a lot of pressure.

221
00:28:23,182 --> 00:28:25,173
Put yourself in her place.

222
00:28:25,887 --> 00:28:29,550
Keeping house and working part-time,

223
00:28:29,659 --> 00:28:32,127
and this place as cramped as it is.

224
00:28:32,628 --> 00:28:35,927
I'm working on finding us
a different place.

225
00:28:39,872 --> 00:28:43,969
Women are always taken
advantage of at the office,

226
00:28:44,177 --> 00:28:46,338
and they don't know
what to do about it.

227
00:28:46,914 --> 00:28:49,907
But she really loves you, you know.
Shit!

228
00:29:01,735 --> 00:29:04,295
- Where's my Michelin guide?
- I didn't touch it.

229
00:29:04,505 --> 00:29:07,531
You know I won't tolerate lying!

230
00:29:07,810 --> 00:29:08,834
It's the truth.

231
00:29:09,044 --> 00:29:11,740
I know I put it away yesterday.

232
00:29:12,617 --> 00:29:13,777
It wasn't me.

233
00:29:13,885 --> 00:29:17,286
Things vanish into thin air
around here!

234
00:29:18,524 --> 00:29:20,151
It wasn't me.

235
00:29:23,832 --> 00:29:26,426
All right. I'll ask your mother.

236
00:29:30,073 --> 00:29:32,405
Time for bed now.

237
00:29:33,444 --> 00:29:35,413
Don't forget the garbage.

238
00:30:32,157 --> 00:30:34,558
- My boss drove me home.
- Your boss.!

239
00:30:34,661 --> 00:30:39,361
- I couldn't very well refuse, could I?
- I hope you get overtime for that!

240
00:30:39,468 --> 00:30:41,231
I will, at the end of the month.

241
00:30:41,436 --> 00:30:43,165
Those services are usually paid in cash!

242
00:30:43,372 --> 00:30:45,136
Oh, knock it off!

243
00:30:45,242 --> 00:30:47,938
No wonder madame needs
to rest on Sunday.

244
00:30:48,179 --> 00:30:52,048
By the way, where's my Michelin guide?
- How should I know? Ask the boy.

245
00:30:52,284 --> 00:30:54,718
- He said he didn't touch it.
- He lies through his teeth.

246
00:30:54,821 --> 00:30:57,222
- Like someone else I know.
- If you raised him better-

247
00:30:57,325 --> 00:30:59,555
I gave him my name, damn it.!
I put food on the table.!

248
00:30:59,828 --> 00:31:03,925
I've had enough of your criticism.!

249
00:31:04,067 --> 00:31:07,559
Fine.! We'll send him to theJesuits
or the army orphans.

250
00:31:07,805 --> 00:31:09,797
At least I'd have some peace and quiet.!

251
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:31,164
You two better eat out
till the end of the month.

252
00:31:31,405 --> 00:31:33,839
For that I need a clean shirt!

253
00:31:34,074 --> 00:31:36,599
If you can't wash the shirt,
at least wash the collar!

254
00:31:36,711 --> 00:31:39,646
You shouldn't have bought
that fog light.

255
00:31:39,749 --> 00:31:42,217
I bought it second-hand.

256
00:31:48,027 --> 00:31:49,824
Go ahead. Open it.

257
00:31:50,764 --> 00:31:52,391
What if it's the gas man?

258
00:31:52,666 --> 00:31:54,726
They give you advance notice.

259
00:32:00,510 --> 00:32:03,138
Morning, sir. I came to see
if Antoine's better today.

260
00:32:04,381 --> 00:32:07,874
- Better? Why?
- He missed school yesterday.

261
00:32:08,455 --> 00:32:10,320
You hear that?

262
00:32:12,193 --> 00:32:14,753
Thanks, kid.
- Good-bye, sir.

263
00:32:21,739 --> 00:32:23,832
You don't seem surprised.

264
00:32:24,109 --> 00:32:25,906
Should I be?

265
00:32:26,144 --> 00:32:28,408
Nothing that boy does surprises me.

266
00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:35,751
- I've gotta come up with an excuse.
- The bigger, the better.

267
00:32:35,992 --> 00:32:39,155
When my mom broke her leg,
I told them the whole story,

268
00:32:39,263 --> 00:32:41,664
except that she was drunk.
I didn't need a note.

269
00:32:41,867 --> 00:32:44,734
Well, I can't use the same story.

270
00:32:44,837 --> 00:32:46,702
And we can't show up together.

271
00:32:46,806 --> 00:32:48,535
Right. You go first.

272
00:33:13,976 --> 00:33:15,671
There you are.

273
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:19,147
A little extra homework
and you get sick, eh?

274
00:33:19,418 --> 00:33:21,249
And your parents fall for it.

275
00:33:21,353 --> 00:33:24,550
Can't wait to see what excuse
you wrangled out of them this time.

276
00:33:24,657 --> 00:33:25,988
Let me see your note.

277
00:33:26,092 --> 00:33:28,254
- I don't have one.
- Don't have one?

278
00:33:28,530 --> 00:33:31,931
You think that's how it works?
It's not that easy, my friend!

279
00:33:33,469 --> 00:33:37,372
- It was... my mother...
- What about her?

280
00:33:37,742 --> 00:33:39,404
She's dead!

281
00:33:39,812 --> 00:33:41,336
Oh, my gosh.

282
00:33:42,115 --> 00:33:45,016
Sorry, son. I didn't know.

283
00:33:45,386 --> 00:33:48,583
Was she ill?
- Yes, sir.

284
00:33:48,790 --> 00:33:52,922
You should've told me.
You should always confide in your teachers.

285
00:33:53,664 --> 00:33:56,360
Go on now. Get in line.

286
00:34:06,881 --> 00:34:10,146
- What excuse did you give him?
- Leave me alone!

287
00:34:21,167 --> 00:34:24,603
- ''Better thorns in the woods than...''
- Than up your-

288
00:34:24,705 --> 00:34:28,700
If you'd wash your ears out, you'd hear
what your classmate is whispering.

289
00:34:28,811 --> 00:34:30,244
Than up your ass.

290
00:34:30,347 --> 00:34:33,578
- He's just trying to confuse me.
- All right, go on.

291
00:34:34,919 --> 00:34:36,945
Now I've lost my place.

292
00:34:38,658 --> 00:34:40,182
''Than flowers in the manger.''

293
00:34:40,293 --> 00:34:43,319
''Than flowers in the manger.
Better to have freedom...''

294
00:34:44,466 --> 00:34:46,525
''And constant threat...''

295
00:34:46,768 --> 00:34:48,964
''Than slavery...''

296
00:34:52,277 --> 00:34:55,804
''In eternal April.'' And you're
an eternal loafer! You get an F.

297
00:34:55,915 --> 00:34:57,712
I knew it at home.

298
00:34:58,517 --> 00:35:00,075
Doinel?

299
00:35:00,321 --> 00:35:01,720
Never mind, son.

300
00:35:01,923 --> 00:35:03,390
Simonot.

301
00:35:03,625 --> 00:35:04,785
''The Hare,''

302
00:35:14,107 --> 00:35:18,135
byJean Richepin.

303
00:35:20,380 --> 00:35:22,348
Sit down, boys.

304
00:35:49,454 --> 00:35:52,355
I suggest the punishment should be in proportion-

305
00:35:52,558 --> 00:35:55,959
He's exceeded all proportion this time.

306
00:35:56,062 --> 00:35:57,962
Only his parents can
be severe enough now.

307
00:35:58,064 --> 00:36:01,000
We'll discuss this tonight.!

308
00:36:08,078 --> 00:36:09,808
What are you gonna do?

309
00:36:10,016 --> 00:36:13,976
I can't live with my parents now
after what's happened.

310
00:36:14,254 --> 00:36:16,313
I have to disappear.

311
00:36:16,557 --> 00:36:18,286
Oh, I've done worse than this.

312
00:36:18,526 --> 00:36:21,587
But I'm fed up.
I have to get out on my own.

313
00:36:21,798 --> 00:36:24,028
I'll write them a letter.

314
00:36:24,134 --> 00:36:26,102
-Just like that?
- Yes, it's for the best.

315
00:36:26,337 --> 00:36:30,240
- Where will you sleep tonight?
- I don't know. I don't really care.

316
00:36:30,642 --> 00:36:32,405
I've got an idea.

317
00:36:32,712 --> 00:36:36,308
Meet me in an hour at Place Pigalle.
- Okay.

318
00:36:59,115 --> 00:37:01,481
It's my uncle's old printing plant.

319
00:37:01,719 --> 00:37:03,949
The machines were so heavy,
the floor caved in.

320
00:37:04,154 --> 00:37:06,054
Think it might cave in some more?

321
00:37:10,631 --> 00:37:14,067
No, it already hit bottom.
You'll be warm here.

322
00:37:26,918 --> 00:37:30,650
Here's your mattress,
and this'll be your pillow.

323
00:37:32,093 --> 00:37:34,027
Damn, it's heavy!

324
00:37:36,399 --> 00:37:38,924
You can just walk around
until midnight.

325
00:37:41,571 --> 00:37:44,166
Keep my briefcase for me.
Give it back to me tomorrow.

326
00:37:44,476 --> 00:37:45,966
Sure.

327
00:37:49,082 --> 00:37:51,846
''Dear Mother and Dad, I understand -''
Misspelled, of course.

328
00:37:51,952 --> 00:37:53,749
''how wrong it was to lie - ''

329
00:37:53,855 --> 00:37:56,484
I'll bet he does.
And why kill me off instead of you?

330
00:37:56,592 --> 00:37:58,457
Personal preference, obviously.

331
00:37:58,696 --> 00:38:01,563
''We can't go on living together.

332
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:04,268
Therefore I'll try my luck alone
in Paris or elsewhere.

333
00:38:04,569 --> 00:38:06,401
I'll prove I can become a man.

334
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:09,734
One day I'll come back
and we'll discuss all that's happened.

335
00:38:09,844 --> 00:38:12,210
Love, Antoine.''

336
00:38:12,448 --> 00:38:14,507
So you think it's normal
for him to hate me?

337
00:38:14,683 --> 00:38:17,915
- You've been so hard on him.
- He gets on my nerves.

338
00:38:40,853 --> 00:38:44,289
- Can you help me catch him?
- Of course, ma'am.

339
00:38:46,293 --> 00:38:49,285
- Is that your sister?
- Never seen her before.

340
00:38:49,398 --> 00:38:52,094
- Is the dog hers?
- I don't know.

341
00:38:55,873 --> 00:38:58,808
- May I help?
- Certainly. The more, the better.

342
00:38:59,077 --> 00:39:01,136
- What's his name?
- I have no idea.

343
00:39:03,449 --> 00:39:06,681
- Beat it, kid.
- She asked me first!

344
00:39:06,954 --> 00:39:08,717
You heard me!

345
00:39:11,728 --> 00:39:14,788
MERRY CHRISTMAS

346
00:42:14,642 --> 00:42:17,634
Doinel, I bet you got it last night.

347
00:42:17,913 --> 00:42:20,575
Not at all. Everything was fine.

348
00:42:20,817 --> 00:42:22,513
Go on now.

349
00:42:22,953 --> 00:42:25,319
Parents spoil these kids rotten.

350
00:42:26,792 --> 00:42:29,352
Need some help over there?

351
00:42:33,001 --> 00:42:35,162
The last question,

352
00:42:35,270 --> 00:42:37,329
even easier this time.

353
00:42:47,954 --> 00:42:51,686
Tip of the tongue between your teeth,
as if you had a lisp.

354
00:42:55,430 --> 00:42:58,798
I can't do it, sir. Not everyone
can make their tongue do that.

355
00:42:59,136 --> 00:43:00,501
Silence!

356
00:43:00,738 --> 00:43:03,969
Go sit down.

357
00:43:05,578 --> 00:43:06,909
Insolent!

358
00:43:08,882 --> 00:43:11,146
Abbou.

359
00:43:11,552 --> 00:43:13,577
Answer this question.

360
00:43:41,359 --> 00:43:43,191
Be seated.

361
00:43:43,797 --> 00:43:46,664
Frochot, you're in charge till I return.

362
00:43:53,441 --> 00:43:56,240
We don't know
what to do with him anymore.

363
00:43:56,580 --> 00:43:59,549
My dear lady, you deserve better.

364
00:44:00,351 --> 00:44:03,718
My poor darling! Are you all right?

365
00:44:03,923 --> 00:44:06,484
Where did you spend the night?
- In a printing plant.

366
00:44:08,029 --> 00:44:11,294
I don't care if he's last in his class.
I just want him to behave.

367
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:13,129
Then we're agreed.

368
00:44:15,873 --> 00:44:18,502
Maybe it's something in his glands.

369
00:44:33,496 --> 00:44:36,021
You mustn't catch cold.

370
00:44:37,168 --> 00:44:39,500
There! Now off to bed.

371
00:44:40,607 --> 00:44:42,370
I'm not tired, Mother.

372
00:44:43,878 --> 00:44:47,006
You'll be more comfortable in our bed.

373
00:44:57,763 --> 00:45:02,292
I was your age once too, you know.
You kids always forget that.

374
00:45:02,402 --> 00:45:05,270
I was stubborn too and didn't want
to confide in my parents.

375
00:45:05,374 --> 00:45:07,638
I preferred writing in my diary.

376
00:45:08,211 --> 00:45:12,080
No one's ever read it.
I'll show it to you one day.

377
00:45:12,983 --> 00:45:15,077
Once when I was your age,
we were on vacation,

378
00:45:15,187 --> 00:45:18,020
and I ran away
with a young farm boy.

379
00:45:18,124 --> 00:45:19,887
Puppy love.
They caught us right away.

380
00:45:20,127 --> 00:45:22,254
Mother made me promise
never to see him again.

381
00:45:22,462 --> 00:45:24,362
She never told my father.

382
00:45:24,465 --> 00:45:26,330
I cried and cried, but I obeyed her,

383
00:45:26,970 --> 00:45:29,234
because you should always obey
your mother.

384
00:45:29,506 --> 00:45:31,997
You and I can share
some little secrets.

385
00:45:32,443 --> 00:45:34,934
Tell me, what did you mean
in your letter when you said:

386
00:45:35,213 --> 00:45:37,408
''We'll discuss all that's happened''?

387
00:45:38,218 --> 00:45:42,315
My misbehaving, and my bad grades.

388
00:45:42,424 --> 00:45:44,415
So talk to me now.

389
00:45:44,526 --> 00:45:46,653
I just can't concentrate.

390
00:45:46,896 --> 00:45:49,421
I want to quit school
and earn a living.

391
00:45:50,468 --> 00:45:52,800
That's nonsense!
Don't you understand?

392
00:45:53,038 --> 00:45:55,836
If you knew how sorry I am
I stopped after high school!

393
00:45:56,076 --> 00:45:58,567
And your father never even finished!

394
00:45:58,979 --> 00:46:01,106
It's hurting his career now.

395
00:46:01,349 --> 00:46:04,376
I know they teach you
a lot of useless stuff in school.

396
00:46:04,487 --> 00:46:06,978
Algebra... science.

397
00:46:07,091 --> 00:46:09,116
Nobody uses that stuff in real life.

398
00:46:09,360 --> 00:46:11,419
But what about French?

399
00:46:11,696 --> 00:46:14,097
One always has letters to write.

400
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:16,698
Here's another secret
you and I can share.

401
00:46:18,940 --> 00:46:23,344
If your next French essay

402
00:46:24,380 --> 00:46:27,077
is in the top five,
I'll give you 1 ,000 francs!

403
00:46:28,219 --> 00:46:30,710
But you mustn't tell your father.

404
00:48:08,053 --> 00:48:09,351
''The dying man pulled himself up

405
00:48:09,556 --> 00:48:13,323
and gave his children
a piercing look.

406
00:48:13,562 --> 00:48:16,360
The hair bristled
on the nape ofhis neck.

407
00:48:16,632 --> 00:48:18,600
His eyes lit up.

408
00:48:18,801 --> 00:48:21,362
A breath caressed his face
and made it sublime.

409
00:48:21,540 --> 00:48:23,701
He raised his hand in anger

410
00:48:23,808 --> 00:48:26,402
and shouted Archimedes' famous last words:

411
00:48:26,512 --> 00:48:29,106
Eureka.! I have found it. ''

412
00:48:42,333 --> 00:48:47,204
Describe a serious event you witnessed
that involved you personally.

413
00:48:49,143 --> 00:48:51,338
Eureka.! I have found it.

414
00:48:54,884 --> 00:49:00,449
''My Grandfather's Death. ''

415
00:49:28,563 --> 00:49:31,692
The boss is sleeping
with the new secretary.

416
00:49:32,636 --> 00:49:34,399
She's well-armed, that girl,

417
00:49:34,638 --> 00:49:38,598
and she used it to get promoted
to executive secretary.

418
00:49:39,778 --> 00:49:42,577
She has all the necessary talents
for the position.

419
00:49:42,883 --> 00:49:46,444
Now I'll have to watch out for her.
Pillow talk and all that.

420
00:49:47,222 --> 00:49:51,057
I showed her how to fudge a bit
on travel expense reports.

421
00:49:51,427 --> 00:49:54,226
She'd only stay in three-star hotels.

422
00:49:55,833 --> 00:49:59,736
By the way, I still haven't found
my Michelin guide.

423
00:50:00,472 --> 00:50:02,463
One of you must have it.

424
00:50:02,742 --> 00:50:06,703
- Don't start with your Michelin guide!
- I don't like mysteries!

425
00:50:07,816 --> 00:50:11,308
- You left something on the stove again.
- No, I didn't.

426
00:50:12,456 --> 00:50:13,445
What's got into him?

427
00:50:14,892 --> 00:50:16,154
This is the last straw!

428
00:50:16,261 --> 00:50:19,698
Stop shouting and get some water!

429
00:50:23,771 --> 00:50:26,137
I've had it, you little idiot!

430
00:50:26,507 --> 00:50:30,137
What got into you,
lighting a candle in there?

431
00:50:30,380 --> 00:50:32,712
It was for Balzac.

432
00:50:33,050 --> 00:50:36,042
- What do you take me for?
- It was for my French essay.

433
00:50:36,321 --> 00:50:38,448
Leave him alone.
He promised me something.

434
00:50:38,758 --> 00:50:41,353
What? To collect
on our fire insurance?

435
00:50:41,628 --> 00:50:45,497
One candle won't do the job.
Here, try this!

436
00:50:46,902 --> 00:50:50,394
As long as you're living under this roof,
you'll do as you're told.

437
00:50:50,874 --> 00:50:53,207
Otherwise we've no other choice
but the military academy.

438
00:50:53,412 --> 00:50:58,180
Know what that is?
They'll keep you in line, all right.

439
00:50:59,819 --> 00:51:01,980
Know what we'll do
to lighten things up?

440
00:51:02,256 --> 00:51:04,691
We'll all go to the movies.

441
00:51:04,861 --> 00:51:08,558
Terrific.
Great way to teach him a lesson.

442
00:51:08,832 --> 00:51:12,701
- Did you write a good essay?
- Not bad.

443
00:51:12,804 --> 00:51:15,273
Julien.

444
00:51:15,776 --> 00:51:19,713
You have to trust us.
You'll be pleasantly surprised.

445
00:51:20,014 --> 00:51:23,074
- No more surprises!
- So are you taking us to the movies?

446
00:51:23,318 --> 00:51:25,013
- What's showing?
- Paris Belongs to Us.

447
00:51:25,320 --> 00:51:28,586
- If this is a plot...
- Unless you'd rather stay home.

448
00:51:28,692 --> 00:51:32,355
Me? I've worked hard.
I deserve to go out.

449
00:51:33,331 --> 00:51:36,994
But they're not fond
of arsonists at the theater.

450
00:51:56,530 --> 00:52:00,262
I never had strawberry
ice cream before!

451
00:52:00,368 --> 00:52:02,360
Must have been out of season.

452
00:52:08,847 --> 00:52:13,479
She sure had... you know...
she had quite a...

453
00:52:13,820 --> 00:52:15,754
That's all you noticed, eh?

454
00:52:15,923 --> 00:52:16,947
A lot of class!

455
00:52:18,861 --> 00:52:20,522
Having a good time back there?

456
00:52:20,629 --> 00:52:23,154
I really liked the movie.

457
00:52:23,299 --> 00:52:25,234
It wasn't funny.

458
00:52:25,336 --> 00:52:28,305
But it had depth.

459
00:52:28,573 --> 00:52:30,438
- What?
- It had depth.

460
00:52:32,111 --> 00:52:33,703
The movie.

461
00:52:38,020 --> 00:52:39,715
Here we are.

462
00:52:46,998 --> 00:52:50,025
General Daredevil and his army!

463
00:52:50,270 --> 00:52:52,602
You're gonna wake the whole building.

464
00:52:53,774 --> 00:52:56,334
Look what pretty legs
your mother has.

465
00:53:07,359 --> 00:53:10,487
Home sweet home.
A bit smoky, eh?

466
00:53:10,865 --> 00:53:12,730
Sweetie, get the garbage.
Be a good boy.

467
00:53:13,034 --> 00:53:17,597
See? I've won him over.
I hope I won't regret it.

468
00:54:07,407 --> 00:54:09,933
Doinel, your paper is first today

469
00:54:10,045 --> 00:54:14,312
only because I decided to return them
in order beginning with the worst.

470
00:54:14,851 --> 00:54:18,948
Your search for perfection
led you straight to an F, my friend.

471
00:54:19,056 --> 00:54:23,961
To those less familiar with Balzac,
what we have here is A Sinister Affair.

472
00:54:24,564 --> 00:54:30,526
That Doinel chose to write about
his grandfather's death was his right.

473
00:54:30,938 --> 00:54:35,343
We know he doesn't hesitate
to sacrifice his relatives, if necessary.

474
00:54:35,445 --> 00:54:37,072
It's not true, sir. I didn't cheat.

475
00:54:37,181 --> 00:54:39,046
Judge for yourselves.

476
00:54:39,918 --> 00:54:42,250
''The dying man pulled himself up

477
00:54:42,354 --> 00:54:45,324
and gave his children
a piercing look.

478
00:54:45,426 --> 00:54:49,295
The hair bristled
on the nape of his neck.

479
00:54:49,397 --> 00:54:52,195
His eyes lit up. A breath caressed
his face and made it sublime.

480
00:54:52,435 --> 00:54:56,203
He raised his hand in anger and
shouted Archimedes' famous last words:

481
00:54:56,307 --> 00:54:57,899
Eureka! I have found it!''

482
00:54:58,010 --> 00:54:59,671
Well, I've found it, too, Doinel.

483
00:55:00,345 --> 00:55:03,041
You're a miserable plagiarist!
- It's not true, sir.

484
00:55:03,149 --> 00:55:06,175
Go to the principal's office
this instant.

485
00:55:06,320 --> 00:55:09,085
Take this and go with him.

486
00:55:09,892 --> 00:55:12,087
I don't want to see you
back here this term!

487
00:55:24,312 --> 00:55:26,212
What are you doing?

488
00:55:27,616 --> 00:55:30,108
I sit next to him.
I would have seen it if he had copied.

489
00:55:30,220 --> 00:55:33,212
- You want to be suspended as well?
- I wouldn't mind.

490
00:55:34,658 --> 00:55:36,057
More insolence!

491
00:55:36,862 --> 00:55:40,025
Get out!
- I don't want to. It's cold outside.

492
00:55:40,433 --> 00:55:42,925
- Get out of here!
- This is illegal.

493
00:55:43,805 --> 00:55:45,864
I'll show you who makes the law here!

494
00:55:46,142 --> 00:55:50,204
Illegal, huh?

495
00:55:57,524 --> 00:56:00,982
- Did you take him to the principal?
- No, he ran away.

496
00:56:06,769 --> 00:56:12,640
I socked him in the jaw and took off.

497
00:56:12,744 --> 00:56:14,177
What about you?

498
00:56:14,279 --> 00:56:16,976
Sourpuss was furious.
I'm suspended till after Christmas.

499
00:56:17,317 --> 00:56:19,649
Poor guy. I'm sorry.

500
00:56:22,857 --> 00:56:26,122
I can't go home now.
That's for sure.

501
00:56:26,428 --> 00:56:28,420
My father said he'd send me
to the academy.

502
00:56:28,666 --> 00:56:31,692
- What academy?
- Something to do with the military.

503
00:56:31,937 --> 00:56:34,633
You'll have a uniform.
Besides, there's a future in the army.

504
00:56:34,941 --> 00:56:38,844
Maybe, but not for me.
If only it were the navy!

505
00:56:39,379 --> 00:56:42,008
I've never seen the ocean.

506
00:56:42,117 --> 00:56:43,982
I've seen the English Channel,
the Atlantic,

507
00:56:44,086 --> 00:56:46,919
and the Mediterranean,
but not the North Sea.

508
00:56:47,390 --> 00:56:50,086
Come on, stay at my place.
We'll manage.

509
00:57:16,731 --> 00:57:18,722
Holy cow, a horse!

510
00:57:19,902 --> 00:57:21,631
One of my father's souvenirs.

511
00:57:23,740 --> 00:57:25,901
This place is huge.

512
00:57:27,579 --> 00:57:30,776
You can sleep here.
No one will know.

513
00:57:31,083 --> 00:57:32,607
What about your parents?

514
00:57:32,752 --> 00:57:34,686
They never come in here.

515
00:57:34,788 --> 00:57:37,587
My mother drinks, and my father
spends all day at the races.

516
00:57:38,427 --> 00:57:42,296
First off, we've got to think of a way
to make some money.

517
00:57:42,565 --> 00:57:44,499
Right, that's the first thing to do.

518
00:57:44,734 --> 00:57:49,196
Right. Meanwhile, I'll take
an advance on my inheritance.

519
00:57:49,509 --> 00:57:52,307
Don't make any noise.
My mother's out there somewhere.

520
00:57:59,521 --> 00:58:01,251
Anyone there?

521
01:00:06,760 --> 01:00:08,352
Good day, ma'am!

522
01:00:08,563 --> 01:00:10,190
Little wretch!

523
01:00:37,702 --> 01:00:41,696
- Have you seen your mother lately?
- Yes, when I came home from school.

524
01:00:43,244 --> 01:00:46,611
She makes sure
she's never home when I am.

525
01:00:47,016 --> 01:00:49,211
She must be up to something.

526
01:00:51,054 --> 01:00:52,817
Where's the fruit?

527
01:01:16,087 --> 01:01:17,748
Take this.

528
01:01:41,623 --> 01:01:44,922
Heavens, 9:30!
I'll be late to the club.

529
01:02:02,784 --> 01:02:05,811
Hurry up, or we'll miss the newsreel.

530
01:02:54,888 --> 01:02:56,549
Boy, I'm thirsty!

531
01:03:00,563 --> 01:03:02,360
Damn! It's empty.

532
01:03:02,599 --> 01:03:04,362
Your turn. Hurry up.

533
01:03:04,602 --> 01:03:06,502
What did you get? Twelve?

534
01:03:15,817 --> 01:03:17,284
My old man!

535
01:03:17,386 --> 01:03:21,289
Help me shake the blankets
to get rid of the smoke.

536
01:03:28,167 --> 01:03:29,794
That's enough.

537
01:03:32,539 --> 01:03:35,531
What's this?
It's a smokehouse in here!

538
01:03:35,743 --> 01:03:37,176
It's like a gambling joint!

539
01:03:37,279 --> 01:03:40,908
I'm taking the cost of three cigars
out of your allowance.

540
01:03:41,152 --> 01:03:44,679
What's this?
Bucephalus is not a coatrack.

541
01:03:46,591 --> 01:03:50,461
He's worth a million at least.
A real work of art.

542
01:03:50,864 --> 01:03:53,833
I'll only get rid of him
if I'm forced to.

543
01:03:54,469 --> 01:03:58,736
Now put the lights out
and go to sleep.

544
01:03:58,841 --> 01:04:00,673
Good night, Dad.

545
01:04:08,087 --> 01:04:09,247
Not bad.

546
01:04:09,522 --> 01:04:11,012
Oh, my gosh!

547
01:04:18,969 --> 01:04:22,564
- Let me see your Michelin guide.
- A million would really do it.

548
01:04:22,841 --> 01:04:25,834
It's my dad's horse.
He'd kill me for sure.

549
01:04:25,946 --> 01:04:28,437
Don't be a wimp.
We could head for the beach,

550
01:04:28,548 --> 01:04:31,142
set up a boat business,
and get everyone off our backs.

551
01:05:29,598 --> 01:05:32,692
- We've got to decide.
- There's one in my dad's office.

552
01:05:32,969 --> 01:05:34,403
Then let's get it.

553
01:05:34,505 --> 01:05:36,666
We can't sell it.
They're all numbered.

554
01:05:36,775 --> 01:05:40,803
But we can hock it.
My mom has hocked everything we own.

555
01:09:16,439 --> 01:09:18,100
- How much?
- Ten percent.

556
01:09:18,307 --> 01:09:19,968
- Okay.
- A thousand in advance.

557
01:09:20,177 --> 01:09:24,114
- No, when you've got the money.
- Trusting guys, aren't you?

558
01:09:58,061 --> 01:10:01,863
Give us back our machine!
Where do you think you're going?

559
01:10:02,234 --> 01:10:04,429
- I thought you were down there.
- Sure you did.

560
01:10:04,704 --> 01:10:06,797
Anyway, it's no go.
They want to see a receipt.

561
01:10:06,906 --> 01:10:08,498
Then give it back.

562
01:10:08,609 --> 01:10:11,773
- Fine, but I want 500 for my trouble.
- We don't have it.

563
01:10:12,014 --> 01:10:15,746
You must have something.
Three hundred and we're even.

564
01:10:15,953 --> 01:10:19,582
- We're broke.
- I don't work for nothing.

565
01:10:19,857 --> 01:10:23,122
I'll keep it as a deposit.
- The hell you will! It's ours!

566
01:10:23,228 --> 01:10:26,721
- Give it back or I'll slug you.
- Hands off!.

567
01:10:26,834 --> 01:10:28,631
It's no more yours than mine.

568
01:10:28,736 --> 01:10:31,534
There's a cop. Let's ask him.

569
01:10:33,876 --> 01:10:37,472
Fine, keep the damned thing,
you little shits.

570
01:10:41,554 --> 01:10:44,045
- I'm tired of carrying this!
- I had my turn.

571
01:10:44,257 --> 01:10:47,193
- My dad's gonna know it was me.
- It was your idea.

572
01:10:47,428 --> 01:10:49,487
- It was yours, asshole!
- Come on!

573
01:10:49,798 --> 01:10:53,029
- I don't care. I'm leaving it here.
- Are you nuts?

574
01:10:53,303 --> 01:10:55,771
I've got to take it back
to the office at least.

575
01:10:56,040 --> 01:11:00,570
But I'm gonna wear a hat in case
the night watchman sees me.

576
01:11:02,181 --> 01:11:03,978
Come on, take it back for me.

577
01:11:04,251 --> 01:11:06,276
No, it wasn't my idea.

578
01:11:06,554 --> 01:11:10,184
You're a real asshole.
At least hold it while I put on my hat.

579
01:11:10,427 --> 01:11:12,395
And wait for me outside.

580
01:11:47,710 --> 01:11:50,440
Well, if it isn't Doinel's son.
I must be seeing things!

581
01:11:50,680 --> 01:11:54,412
Put that down.
Boy, is your daddy gonna love this!

582
01:11:55,053 --> 01:11:59,253
I'll show them I know my job.

583
01:11:59,693 --> 01:12:03,356
I'm warning you, don't try anything.

584
01:12:03,631 --> 01:12:06,191
I don't like little punks like you.

585
01:12:07,336 --> 01:12:11,206
Mr. Doinel, forgive me
for bothering you.

586
01:12:12,076 --> 01:12:14,840
You better come here, sir.

587
01:12:16,115 --> 01:12:20,349
Let's say it's a surprise...
but not a pleasant one.

588
01:12:23,325 --> 01:12:25,316
Don't touch that hat!

589
01:12:30,701 --> 01:12:33,364
It's no party I'm taking you to
this time.

590
01:12:33,639 --> 01:12:37,075
The games are over. Your mother
and I will finally have some peace.

591
01:12:37,310 --> 01:12:40,575
Take a good look at your pal,

592
01:12:40,848 --> 01:12:43,647
'cause you won't be
seeing him again for a while.

593
01:12:58,373 --> 01:13:02,276
Maybe this'll straighten you out.
This had to end sooner or later.

594
01:13:02,478 --> 01:13:05,675
If I had done this at your age,
my father would have killed me!

595
01:13:08,352 --> 01:13:10,217
May we see the chief?

596
01:13:14,961 --> 01:13:19,423
We've tried everything:
kindness, persuasion, punishment.

597
01:13:19,534 --> 01:13:21,365
But we never beat him, mind you.

598
01:13:21,571 --> 01:13:24,665
- Sometimes the good old ways -
- Of course.

599
01:13:24,875 --> 01:13:27,537
But his mother and I aren't like that.

600
01:13:28,079 --> 01:13:30,412
We gave him a lot of freedom.
- Too much, perhaps.

601
01:13:30,649 --> 01:13:35,451
And with both of us working -
You know how it is.

602
01:13:35,556 --> 01:13:37,990
Yes, I'm a father too.

603
01:13:38,192 --> 01:13:40,559
I must admit it's not always easy.

604
01:13:40,663 --> 01:13:43,564
If only he'd talk to us.

605
01:13:43,667 --> 01:13:45,828
But when we talk to him,
he's a thousand miles away.

606
01:13:46,036 --> 01:13:48,368
You think he's listening now?

607
01:13:48,473 --> 01:13:51,567
Here's how I found him
with the typewriter.

608
01:13:51,677 --> 01:13:54,044
Who knows what goes on
in that head of his!

609
01:13:56,951 --> 01:13:59,351
Take this boy's statement.

610
01:13:59,622 --> 01:14:01,886
Vagrancy and theft.

611
01:14:02,425 --> 01:14:04,291
Come with me.

612
01:14:09,269 --> 01:14:11,203
What have you decided?

613
01:14:12,072 --> 01:14:15,805
We can't take him back home now.
He'll just run away again.

614
01:14:16,345 --> 01:14:20,908
Perhaps you could place him somewhere,
like a camp in the country?

615
01:14:21,451 --> 01:14:24,284
And put him to work,
'cause he won't study anymore.

616
01:14:24,822 --> 01:14:27,223
We can try the Observation Center.

617
01:14:27,327 --> 01:14:30,888
It's well organized,
and he'll learn a skill.

618
01:14:30,998 --> 01:14:35,197
- It'll do him good.
- Assuming there's room, of course.

619
01:14:35,704 --> 01:14:40,143
And you'd have to transfer
your parental rights.

620
01:14:41,512 --> 01:14:44,276
Yes, to the juvenile justice system.

621
01:14:44,616 --> 01:14:47,847
He'll appear in juvenile court tomorrow.

622
01:14:47,953 --> 01:14:51,014
You or your wife must be present.

623
01:14:53,062 --> 01:14:55,724
Did anyone see you enter the building?

624
01:14:56,800 --> 01:15:02,570
''I hereby declare that,
having entered the premises...''

625
01:15:09,316 --> 01:15:12,342
''...a typewriter.''

626
01:15:15,792 --> 01:15:18,056
Sign here.

627
01:15:18,295 --> 01:15:21,560
Charles, he's all yours.

628
01:15:26,307 --> 01:15:27,968
This way.

629
01:15:36,987 --> 01:15:39,547
You take him from here.
I'm going home.

630
01:16:14,304 --> 01:16:16,101
What did you do?

631
01:16:16,574 --> 01:16:18,838
I ran away from home.

632
01:16:19,244 --> 01:16:20,836
What about you?

633
01:16:21,780 --> 01:16:23,408
Oh, you know...

634
01:17:05,940 --> 01:17:08,340
Here come the girls.

635
01:17:13,251 --> 01:17:17,188
I saw a police station in a movie once.
It was a lot cleaner.

636
01:17:18,424 --> 01:17:21,792
- I saw one that was a lot dirtier.
- I've seen more cheerful ones.

637
01:18:06,957 --> 01:18:09,119
The coach is here.

638
01:18:27,117 --> 01:18:28,812
Put on your jacket.

639
01:20:25,878 --> 01:20:29,406
Tie, belt and shoelaces.
Empty your pockets.

640
01:20:33,655 --> 01:20:35,418
Sign here.

641
01:20:57,688 --> 01:20:59,417
Sign here.

642
01:23:43,545 --> 01:23:46,242
We could try taking him back
if we had to,

643
01:23:46,383 --> 01:23:48,977
but he'd have to change
his ways entirely.

644
01:23:49,087 --> 01:23:51,647
If only you could scare some sense
into him, Your Honor.

645
01:23:51,757 --> 01:23:54,988
- That's not my role.
- We can't control him.

646
01:23:55,095 --> 01:23:59,033
Perhaps you exercise control
too inconsistently.

647
01:23:59,134 --> 01:24:03,333
Is it true he was left home alone
for an entire weekend?

648
01:24:03,673 --> 01:24:06,164
My husband belongs to a racing club.

649
01:24:06,444 --> 01:24:08,845
We might have left him home alone.

650
01:24:09,047 --> 01:24:10,480
Besides, he hates sports.

651
01:24:10,583 --> 01:24:13,916
He prefers to hole up in a theater
for hours, ruining his eyes.

652
01:24:14,755 --> 01:24:17,053
What does your husband think?
It's his son, after all.

653
01:24:17,859 --> 01:24:20,658
Well, no, he isn't.

654
01:24:20,831 --> 01:24:22,662
He married me when the boy was small.

655
01:24:22,933 --> 01:24:24,833
He deserves credit for that.

656
01:24:25,870 --> 01:24:28,703
- I shouldn't have told you that.
- On the contrary.

657
01:24:28,941 --> 01:24:33,004
I think we'd best put the boy
in an observation center.

658
01:24:33,280 --> 01:24:36,477
Could it be near the seashore,
Your Honor?

659
01:24:36,718 --> 01:24:39,346
It's not a vacation resort, ma'am.

660
01:24:39,555 --> 01:24:42,719
I'll do my best,
depending on what's available.

661
01:24:42,960 --> 01:24:46,191
He'll stay there a few months
while I study his case.

662
01:24:46,464 --> 01:24:48,694
Then we'll make a decision.

663
01:24:49,401 --> 01:24:51,892
Believe me, this change
can only do him good.

664
01:24:52,172 --> 01:24:54,573
Good-bye, Your Honor.

665
01:24:58,381 --> 01:25:02,716
OBSERVATION CENTER
FOR DELI NQUENT YOUTH

666
01:25:37,867 --> 01:25:40,666
- Why are you in here?
- Oh, you know. What about you?

667
01:25:40,772 --> 01:25:43,741
- I messed up.
- I stole a typewriter.

668
01:25:44,009 --> 01:25:46,341
A typewriter?
That wasn't too smart.

669
01:25:46,580 --> 01:25:50,517
No wonder you got caught.
They all have serial numbers.

670
01:25:50,818 --> 01:25:55,154
See that big guy over there?
He stole tires off cars.

671
01:25:56,226 --> 01:25:58,626
Whenever I'd cry,

672
01:25:58,862 --> 01:26:03,392
my father would imitate me
on his violin,just to bug me.

673
01:26:03,703 --> 01:26:07,264
But one day I snapped
and just knocked him out cold.

674
01:26:07,541 --> 01:26:10,203
Good for you. If my old man
did that to me, I'd kill him.

675
01:26:12,615 --> 01:26:15,517
- Look.!
- Who's that guy?

676
01:26:15,619 --> 01:26:18,816
He escaped a week ago,
but they got him.

677
01:26:21,260 --> 01:26:24,559
Around here, to escape is bad enough,
but to get caught is worse.

678
01:26:33,175 --> 01:26:36,907
What are you doing there?
Two lines, on the double!

679
01:26:37,447 --> 01:26:40,281
What are you up to there?
Now march!

680
01:27:40,100 --> 01:27:42,125
Show me your bread.

681
01:27:42,803 --> 01:27:44,327
Good.

682
01:27:45,006 --> 01:27:46,803
I see you started already.

683
01:27:47,075 --> 01:27:49,340
Bring your bread and plate over here.

684
01:27:55,053 --> 01:27:56,520
Put them down.

685
01:28:00,661 --> 01:28:02,526
Right hand or left?

686
01:28:03,030 --> 01:28:04,895
Left, sir.

687
01:28:12,077 --> 01:28:14,011
No talking.!

688
01:28:22,324 --> 01:28:23,689
This is for you.

689
01:28:23,959 --> 01:28:27,451
I bet they'd catch you, and I won.

690
01:28:32,570 --> 01:28:35,438
So what? I lived it up for five days,

691
01:28:35,542 --> 01:28:37,942
and I'm ready to try it again
first chance I get.

692
01:28:38,245 --> 01:28:39,974
What are you doing there?

693
01:28:43,452 --> 01:28:45,819
Kanayan, your turn
to see the psychologist.

694
01:28:46,557 --> 01:28:48,457
If she drops her pen, pick it up,

695
01:28:48,693 --> 01:28:51,253
but don't look at her legs,
or else it goes in your file.

696
01:28:51,529 --> 01:28:52,962
What file?

697
01:28:53,065 --> 01:28:56,262
You know, what everyone thinks of you:
the judge, the doctor,

698
01:28:56,369 --> 01:28:58,497
even your neighbors back home.

699
01:28:58,739 --> 01:29:01,003
I know mine by heart.

700
01:29:01,276 --> 01:29:05,373
It says I'm unstable,
with perverted tendencies.

701
01:29:05,615 --> 01:29:07,708
What if I talk nonsense
just to confuse them?

702
01:29:07,985 --> 01:29:11,787
Then it's the funny farm
or boot camp.

703
01:29:18,299 --> 01:29:20,325
Why did you return the typewriter?

704
01:29:20,603 --> 01:29:25,132
Well, since I couldn't sell it
or anything, I got scared.

705
01:29:26,077 --> 01:29:29,069
I don't know why I returned it.
Just 'cause.

706
01:29:29,982 --> 01:29:33,111
It seems you stole 1 0, 000 francs
from your grandmother.

707
01:29:33,420 --> 01:29:35,752
She had invited me for her birthday.

708
01:29:35,990 --> 01:29:40,985
I thought since she's old and doesn't
eat much, she doesn't need the money.

709
01:29:41,230 --> 01:29:42,663
She was going to die soon.

710
01:29:42,899 --> 01:29:46,597
So, since I knew where she kept
her dough, I swiped some.

711
01:29:47,238 --> 01:29:51,471
I knew she wouldn't notice,
and she didn't.

712
01:29:51,811 --> 01:29:55,213
She gave me a nice book that day.

713
01:29:55,918 --> 01:30:00,288
But my mother,
she used to go through my pockets.

714
01:30:00,390 --> 01:30:02,858
I left my pants on the bed that night,

715
01:30:02,960 --> 01:30:07,831
and she must have found the money in
my pocket, 'cause next day it was gone.

716
01:30:08,501 --> 01:30:12,905
Later, she mentioned it and
I had to confess where I got it.

717
01:30:13,173 --> 01:30:16,574
And then she took the nice book away
my grandmother gave me.

718
01:30:17,212 --> 01:30:19,704
One day I asked for it back,

719
01:30:20,216 --> 01:30:22,707
and I found out she'd sold it.

720
01:30:24,255 --> 01:30:26,849
Your parents say you're always lying.

721
01:30:27,559 --> 01:30:30,757
Oh, I lie now and then, I suppose.

722
01:30:31,131 --> 01:30:34,157
Sometimes I'd tell them the truth
and they still wouldn't believe me,

723
01:30:34,269 --> 01:30:36,430
so I prefer to lie.

724
01:30:36,739 --> 01:30:38,900
Why don't you like your mother?

725
01:30:39,108 --> 01:30:41,907
Well, first she sent me
to live with a wet nurse.

726
01:30:42,146 --> 01:30:45,172
Then, when they had no more money,
they sent me to my grandmother.

727
01:30:45,384 --> 01:30:49,253
But she got old and
couldn't take care of me anymore,

728
01:30:49,522 --> 01:30:53,084
so, when I was eight,
I went back to live with my parents.

729
01:30:53,528 --> 01:30:55,723
I could tell Mother didn't like me.

730
01:30:55,965 --> 01:30:59,732
She was always yelling at me
for no reason.

731
01:31:01,806 --> 01:31:06,142
There were fights at home,

732
01:31:06,747 --> 01:31:09,272
and I overheard

733
01:31:10,451 --> 01:31:16,392
that my mother had me
before she was married.

734
01:31:16,761 --> 01:31:21,062
And she had a fight
with my grandmother once.

735
01:31:21,733 --> 01:31:24,327
That's when I found out that
she had wanted to have an abortion.

736
01:31:24,637 --> 01:31:26,798
It's thanks to my grandmother
that I was born.

737
01:31:27,106 --> 01:31:29,940
Have you ever slept with a girl?

738
01:31:33,783 --> 01:31:36,513
No, but some friends of mine have.

739
01:31:36,787 --> 01:31:41,089
They told me where
the hookers hang out.

740
01:31:41,460 --> 01:31:45,397
So I went and tried
to pick up some girls,

741
01:31:45,632 --> 01:31:48,760
but they all yelled at me
so I got scared and I left.

742
01:31:48,969 --> 01:31:51,268
I went back a couple times.

743
01:31:51,374 --> 01:31:55,141
Once a man saw me and asked me
what I was doing there.

744
01:31:55,312 --> 01:31:58,179
He was North African.
So I told him.

745
01:31:58,416 --> 01:32:04,288
I guess he knew a lot of women,
and he said he knew one

746
01:32:04,624 --> 01:32:07,855
who liked guys my age.

747
01:32:08,530 --> 01:32:11,897
So he took me to her hotel,

748
01:32:12,168 --> 01:32:14,933
only she wasn't there that day.

749
01:32:15,039 --> 01:32:18,806
We waited an hour or two,
but she didn't show up, so I left.

750
01:32:50,187 --> 01:32:51,176
Rene!

751
01:33:17,056 --> 01:33:19,251
Don't look for your father.
I came alone.

752
01:33:19,459 --> 01:33:21,188
Is it that way?

753
01:33:45,027 --> 01:33:48,486
Your letter to your father
hurt him very much.

754
01:33:49,234 --> 01:33:51,759
You were naive to think
he wouldn't show it to me.

755
01:33:51,870 --> 01:33:54,430
In spite of appearances,
we're a devoted couple,

756
01:33:54,640 --> 01:33:58,441
and it wasn't smart to remind him
of some unhappy days I went through.

757
01:33:58,678 --> 01:34:01,307
Thanks to him, you have a name.

758
01:34:03,085 --> 01:34:07,022
We were ready to take you back,

759
01:34:07,291 --> 01:34:09,418
but the neighbors' gossip
put an end to that.

760
01:34:09,526 --> 01:34:11,552
You must have told
everyone in the neighborhood!

761
01:34:11,664 --> 01:34:13,791
I never said a word, Mother.

762
01:34:13,900 --> 01:34:17,597
But I'm used to it. I've been
criticized by imbeciles all my life.

763
01:34:17,871 --> 01:34:20,533
Anyway, that's all I had to tell you.

764
01:34:20,742 --> 01:34:23,075
And don't go crying to your father.

765
01:34:23,346 --> 01:34:27,078
He said to let you know he's washed
his hands of you completely.

766
01:34:27,585 --> 01:34:30,884
All you're good for now is
reform school or a labor center.

767
01:34:31,189 --> 01:34:33,020
You wanted to earn your living?

768
01:34:33,126 --> 01:34:35,857
Now we'll see how you like it.

769
01:39:28,500 --> 01:39:32,561
THE END
