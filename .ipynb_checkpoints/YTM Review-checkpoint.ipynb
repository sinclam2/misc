    "\n",
    "- Yield to maturity (YTM) is the total return anticipated on a bond if the bond is held until it matures.\n",
    "    - YTM is a *long-term* rate of return\n",
    "        - Expressed annually\n",
    "- In other words, the **YTM is the IRR for the bond**"

    "## How is this different from Current Yield?\n",
    "\n",
    "- The current yield of a bond is the **annual income of the bond as a fraction of the market price**\n",
    "    - **Note**: Current Yield uses market price instead of face value in the calculation\n",
    "    \n",
    "#### Why do we care about current yield?\n",
    "\n",
    "- It tells us what our return will be if we buy the bond today and sell it in a year\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Is this not the same as the coupon?\n",
    "\n",
    "- No\n",
    "    - **Why?**\n",
    "        - Because we're using the market price instead of the face value\n",
    "        \n",
    "#### Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "- If we buy a 6% coupon bond at a discount of \\$900, then our current yield will be:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\left ( \\text{Current Yield} \\right ) = \\frac{0.06\\cdot 1000}{900} = 0.0667\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "- Now, assume we bought the same bond for \\$1,100 instead of \\$900\n",
    "\n",

    "\\left ( \\text{Current Yield} \\right ) = \\frac{0.06\\cdot 1000}{1100} = 0.0545\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Therefore, compared to the Current Yield, 1) YTM considers more than just the next year and 2) unlike CY, YTM accounts for the time value of money (by using a discount rate in the calculation)\n",
    "\n",
    "- For these reasons, YTM is considered to be a more thorough measure of the return for a bond"
